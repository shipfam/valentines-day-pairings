valentines-day-pairings
=======================


This was a SAS job to run through a spreadsheet of people and addresses and a preference of how many
valentine's day cards they wanted to send out, and pair them up with each other.

Pairings were not bi-directional.

There was some noise thrown in as well to add to the magic.
